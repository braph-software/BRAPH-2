%% Functions to calculate In Path Length from 2019_03_03_BCT
function  [lambda,efficiency,ecc,radius,diameter] = charpath(D,diagonal_dist,infinite_dist)
%CHARPATH       Characteristic path length, global efficiency and related statistics
%
%   lambda                                  = charpath(D);
%   lambda                                  = charpath(D);

%   [lambda,efficiency,ecc,radius,diameter] = charpath(D,diagonal_dist,infinite_dist);
%
%   The network characteristic path length is the average shortest path
%   length between all pairs of nodes in the network. The global efficiency
%   is the average inverse shortest path length in the network. The nodal
%   eccentricity is the maximal path length between a node and any other
%   node in the network. The radius is the minimal eccentricity, and the
%   diameter is the maximal eccentricity.
%
%   Input:      D,              distance matrix
%               diagonal_dist   optional argument
%                               include distances on the main diagonal
%                                   (default: diagonal_dist=0)
%               infinite_dist   optional argument
%                               include infinite distances in calculation
%                                   (default: infinite_dist=1)
%
%   Outputs:    lambda,         network characteristic path length
%               efficiency,     network global efficiency
%               ecc,            nodal eccentricity
%               radius,         network radius
%               diameter,       network diameter
%
%   Notes:
%       The input distance matrix may be obtained with any of the distance
%   functions, e.g. distance_bin, distance_wei.
%       Characteristic path length is defined here as the mean shortest
%   path length between all pairs of nodes, for consistency with common
%   usage. Note that characteristic path length is also defined as the
%   median of the mean shortest path length from each node to all other
%   nodes.
%       Infinitely long paths (i.e. paths between disconnected nodes) are
%   included in computations by default. This behavior may be modified with
%   via the infinite_dist argument.
