\begin{abstract}
\noindent
The software architecture of BRAPH~2 provides a clear structure for developers to understand and extend its functionalities. All objects (\emph{elements}) in BRAPH~2 are derived from the base object \code{Element}. Developers can easily add new elements by writing the new elements in the simplified BRAPH~2 pseudocode. 
By recompiling BRAPH~2, the new elements and their functionalities are immediately integrated, also into the graphical user interface.
In this developer tutorial, you will learn how BRAPH~2 is compiled, how the elements are strcutured, and how new elements can be implemented.

\section{Compilation and Element (Re)Generation}

BRAPH~2 is a compiled object-oriented programming software.
Its objects are \emph{elements}, which contain a set of \emph{props} of various \emph{categories} and \emph{formats}, as described in detail in the following sections. 
These elements are written in the BRAPH~2 pseudocode, which simplifies and streamlines the coding process.
To convert them into usable MatLab objects, BRAPH~2 needs to be compiled, which is done by calling the script \code{braph2genesis}, which will compile the whole BRAPH~2 code base, as shown in \Coderef{cd:compilation}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:compilation,
	caption={
		{\bf Compilation of BRAPH~2.}
		Executing the script \code{braph2genesis} compiles BRAPH~2 and , subsequently, unit tests it.
		Importantly, this script might take several hours to run (plus several more hours to unit test the compiled code).
	}
]
>> braph2genesis
\end{lstlisting}

During the compilation, there are several phases to improve the computational efficiency of the executable code:
\begin{enumerate}

\item{} {\bf First compilation}, where the elements are created.

\item{} {\bf Second compilation}, where the elements are computationally optimized.

\item{} {\bf Constant hard-coding}, where several contants are hard-coded in the executable code to further optimize the run time.

\end{enumerate}

Because of this multi-stage compilation, it is not always possible to regenerate a single element without regenerating the whole BRAPH~2. 
Nevertheless, it is usually possible to regenerate a single element as long as the element already exists and its props have not been changed.
This can be done with the function \code{regenerate()}, as shown in \Coderef{cd:regenerate}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:regenerate,
	caption={
		{\bf Regeneration of elements.}
		The function \code{regenerate()} can be used to regenerate some elements, as long as they already exist in the current BRAPH~2 compilation and their list of props has not been altered (e.g., renamed, moved, added), in which case it is necessary to recompile BRAPH~2 with \code{braph2genesis}.

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Elements}

The base class for all elements is \code{Element}. 
Each element is essentially a container for a series of \emph{props} (properties). Each prop is characterized by the following static features (i.e., equal for all instances of the prop):
\begin{itemize}

\item A \emph{sequential number} (integer starting from 1).
		
\item A \emph{tag} (a string).
	
\item A \emph{category}, which determines for how a prop is used.\footnote{The possible categories and formats are shown in the boxes below.}
	
\item A \emph{format}, which determines what a prop can contain.

\end{itemize}
The functions to inspect these features can be found by using the command \code{help Element} in the MatLab command line.

Furthermore, each instance of a prop has the following features:
\begin{itemize}

\item A \emph{value}.\footnote{The value is by defalut a \code{NoValue}. For \code{PARAMETER}, \code{DATA}, \code{FIGURE}, and \code{GUI} props, it can also be a callback. For \code{CONSTANT} props, it is usually a concrete value.}
	The functions to set, get, and memorize a value will be discussed in the following sections.
	
\item A \emph{seed} for the random number generator to ensure the reproducibility of the results. 
	The seed of each property is a 32-bit unsigned integer and is initialized when an element is constructed by calling \code{randi(intmax('uint32'))}.
	
	The seed can be obtained using:\\
	\code{seed = el.getPropSeed(pointer)}\\
	where \code{pointer} can be either a prop number or tag.
	It cannot be changed.
 	
\item A \emph{checked} status, which is true by default.
	Checked props are checked for format when they are set and for value when they are set/calculated.\footnote{When \code{BRAPH2.CHECKED = false}, no checks are performed. This needs to be changed in the file \fn{BRAPH2.m}.}
	
	The checked status of a prop can be altered with the functions:\\
	\code{el.checked(pointer)}\\
	\code{el.unchecked(pointer)}\\
	The checked status of a prop can be assessed with the function:
	\code{checked = el.isChecked(pointer)}\\
	where \code{pointer} can be either a prop number or tag.
	
\item A \emph{locked} status, which is false by default.\footnote{The \code{PARAMETER} and \code{DATA} props get locked the first time a \code{RESULT} property is successfully calculated. The locked status is not used for \code{CONSTANT} props.}
	
	A prop can be locked with the function:\\
	\code{el.lock(pointer)}\\
	Once locked, it cannot be unlocked.
	The locked status of a prop can be assessed with the function:\\
	\code{locked = el.isLocked(pointer)}\\
	where \code{pointer} can be either a prop number or tag.
	
\item A \emph{callback} instance.\footnote{Callbacks are not used with \code{METADATA} props.}
	
	The callback to a prop can be obtained using the function:\\
	\code{cb = el.getCallback(pointer)}\\
	where \code{pointer} can be either a prop number or tag.
	
\end{itemize}
Additional functions to operate with these features can be found by using the command \code{help Element} in the MatLab command line.

Even though it is possible to create instances of \code{Element}, it does not have any props and typically one uses its subclasses.
Its three direct subclasses are \code{NoValue}, \code{Callback}, and \code{ConcreteElement}, as shown in \Figref{fig:elements}.

\fig{figure*}
	{fig:elements}
	{\includegraphics{fig01_big.jpg}}
	{Element tree}
	{
	All elements derive from the base class \code{Element}. 
	Its direct children are \code{NoValue}, \code{Callback}, and \code{ConcreteElement}, whose properties are also indicated.
	Concrete elements further derive directly or indirectly from \code{ConcreteElement}.
	}

%! FIG1 !%

The element \code{NoValue} is used to represent a value that has not been set (for properties of categories \code{METADATA}, \code{PARAMETER}, \code{DATA}, \code{FIGURE} or \code{GUI}) or calculated (for properties of category \code{RESULT}, \code{QUERY}, \code{EVANESCENT}), while it should not be used for properties of category \code{CONSTANT}.
It should be instantiated using \Coderef{cd:novalue}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:novalue,
	caption={
		{\bf Instantiation of \code{NoValue}.}
		For computational efficiency, it is best to use only one instance using this script, instead of creating new instances using the constructor \code{NoValue()}. 
	}
]
Element.getNoValue()
\end{lstlisting}

No element can be a subclass of NoValue.
  
A \code{Callback} refers to a prop of another element \code{el}, identified by prop number or tag.
It should be instantiated using \Coderef{cd:callback}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:callback,
	caption={
		{\bf Instantiation of a \code{Callback}.}
		For computational efficiency, it is best to use only one instance of \code{Callback} for each prop of an instance of a concrete element \code{el} with the code shown below, instead of creating new callback instances using its constructor. 
	}
]
el.getCallback('PROP', PROP_NUMBER)
el.getCallback('TAG', PROP_TAG)
\end{lstlisting}

No element can be a subclass of \code{Callback}.

A concrete element (\code{ConcreteElement}) provides the infrastructure necessary for all concrete elements. 
In particular, it has the constant props \code{ELCLASS} (string), \code{NAME} (string) and \code{DESCRIPTION} (string), the property \code{TEMPLATE} (item), the indexing properties \code{ID} (string), \code{LABEL} (string), and \code{NOTES} (string), and the query prop \code{TOSTRING} (string).
Even though it is possible to create instances of \code{ConcreteElement}, typically one uses its subclasses.

\subsection{Setting Props}

The value of a prop can be set with \Coderef{cd:set}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:set,
	caption={
		{\bf Setting a prop.}
		This script illustrates various ways in which props can be set.
	}
]
el.set('ID', 'new el id') ¥\circled{1}\circlednote{1}{ and \circled{2} set the value of a prop with the prop tag or the prop number.}¥
el.set(5, 'new el id') ¥\circled{2}¥

el.set( ... ¥\circled{3}\circlednote{3}{ sets the values of multiple props at once. The pointers can be either property numbers or property tags.}¥
	'ID', 'new el id', ...
	'LABEL', 'new el label', ...
	7, 'new el notes' ...
	) 

el = el.set('ID', 'new el id') ¥\circled{4}\circlednote{4}{ returns the element.}¥
\end{lstlisting}

When a prop is set to a certain value, the following operations are performed:
\begin{enumerate}

\item{} The value is {\bf conditioned} before being set (by calling the protected \emph{static} function \code{conditioning()}, which can be defined in each subelement).
	
	This can be set with the token \code{¡conditioning!}.
	
\item{} The value is {\bf preset} before being set (by calling the protected function \code{preset()}, which can be defined in each subelement).\footnote{Differently from the \emph{static} function \code{conditioning()}, the function \code{preset()} has access to the element instance.}

	This can be set with the token \code{¡preset!}.
	
\item{} If a property is checked, its {\bf format is checked} before proceeding to its setting by calling \code{Format.checkFormat()}.\\
	If the check fails, the property is not set and an error is thrown with error id \code{BRAPH2:<Element Class>:WrongInput}.
	
	This can be set with the token \code{¡checkProp!}.

\item{} The value is {\bf set}.

	If the property is of category \code{PARAMETER}, \code{DATA}, \code{FIGURE}, or \code{GUI}, the value is set only if the property is unlocked.\\
	If an attempt is made to set a locked property, no setting occurs and a warning is thrown with warning id \code{BRAPH2:<Element Class>}.\\
	If the value is a callback, a warning is thrown if the element, property number and/or settings of the callback do not coincide with those of the property with warning id \code{BRAPH2:<Element Class>}.
 
	If the property is of category \code{RESULT}, \code{QUERY} or \code{EVANESCENT}, the value can only be set to \code{Element.getNoValue()}.

\item{} The value is {\bf postset} after being set (by calling the protected function \code{postset()}, which is defined in each subelement).
	
	This can be set with the token \code{¡postset!}.

\item{} {\bf All props} are {\bf postprocessed} after being set (by calling the protected function \code{postprocessing()}, which is defined in each subelement).
	
	This can be set with the token \code{¡postprocessing!}.

\item{} If ANY property is checked, the function \code{Element.check()} is called after all settings are made and the consistency of the values of {\bf all pros} are {\bf checked}.\\
	If the check fails an error is thrown with error id \code{BRAPH2:<Element Class>:WrongInput}.
	
\item{} When a prop is successfully set, an {\bf event} \code{PropSet()} is {\bf notified}.

\end{enumerate} 

\subsection{Getting Props}

The value of a prop can be retrieved with \Coderef{cd:get}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:get,
	caption={
		{\bf Getting a prop.}
		This script illustrates various ways in which the value of a prop can be retrieved.
	}
]
value = el.get('ID'); ¥\circled{1}\circlednote{1}{ gets the value of a prop using the prop tag.}¥

value = el.get(ConcreteElement.ID); ¥\circled{2}\circlednote{2}{ gets the value of a prop using the prop number.}¥

el.get('ID') ¥\circled{3}\circlednote{3}{ and \circled{4} do not return any output value. This can be useful, e.g., when a code needs to be executed, e.g., by a \code{QUERY}.}¥
el.get(ConcreteElement.ID) ¥\circled{4}¥

value = el.get('QUERY', ARG1, ARG2, ... ); ¥\circled{5}\circlednote{5}{ can be used with a series of arguments for props of category \code{QUERY}. Any additional arguments are ignored for props of other categories.}¥
\end{lstlisting}

If the raw value of the property is a \code{NoValue}, it proceed to return the default property value (for categories \code{METADATA}, \code{PARAMETER}, \code{DATA}, \code{FIGURE}, and \code{GUI}).
 
If the raw value of the property is a callback, it retrieves the value of the linked property (for categories \code{PARAMETER}, \code{DATA}, \code{FIGURE}, and \code{GUI}).
 
If a property of category \code{RESULT}, \code{QUERY}, or \code{EVANESCENT} is not calculated (i.e., its raw value is \code{NoValue}), it proceeds to calculate it (but not to memorize it, i.e., its raw value remains \code{NoValue}). After the calculation of a property of category \code{RESULT} all properties of categories \code{PARAMETER} and \code{DATA} are irreversibly locked.
If the property is checked, it proceeds to check all properties after the calculation calling the function \code{check()}. If the check fails, it resets the property to \code{NoValue} and returns \code{NoValue}, does not lock the property, and throws a warning with warning id \code{BRAPH2:<Element Class>}.

The raw value of a prop can be retrieved with \Coderef{cd:getr}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:getr,
	caption={
		{\bf Getting the raw value of a prop.}
		This script illustrates various ways in which the raw value of a prop can be retrieved.
	}
]
value = el.getr('ID');
value = el.getr(ConcreteElement.ID);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Memorizing Props}  

The value of a prop can be memorized using \Coderef{cd:memorize}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:memorize,
	caption={
		{\bf Memorizing a prop.}
		This script illustrates various ways in which the value of a prop can be memorized.
	}
]
value = el.memorize('ID'); ¥\circled{1}\circlednote{1}{ and \circled{2} memorize the value of a prop using the prop tag and the prop number.}¥
value = el.memorize(ConcreteElement.ID); ¥\circled{2}¥

el.memorize('ID') ¥\circled{3}\circlednote{3}{ and \circled{4} do not return any output value.}¥
el.memorize(ConcreteElement.ID) ¥\circled{4}¥
\end{lstlisting}

If the property is of category \code{RESULT}, \code{QUERY}, or \code{EVANESCENT}, it calls the function check, proceed to save the result, and notifies an {\bf event PropMemorized}.

If the property is \emph{not} of category \code{RESULT}, \code{QUERY}, or \code{EVANESCENT} and has not been set yet, it sets it to its default value.
 
If the property is \emph{not} of category \code{RESULT}, \code{QUERY}, or \code{EVANESCENT} and is a callback, it iteratively memorizes the property of the element in the callback.
 
If a property of category \code{QUERY} is memorized, a warning is thrown with warning id \code{BRAPH2:<Element Class>}, because query properties are generally not supposed to be memorized. If such behavior is intended, consider enclosing the command between warning off and warning on.

\section{Element tokens}

A generator file has the structure illustrated \Coderef{cd:tokens}.

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:tokens,
	caption={
		{\bf Element tokens in a generator file.}
		All tokens available in a generator file.
		The name of this file must end with \fn{.gen.m}, and tipically starts with \fn{\_}.

\section{Overview of Elements}

\fig{figure*}

	{\includegraphics{../braph2genesis.png}}
	{BRAPH~2 genesis.}
	{
	Directory structure of \fn{braph2genesis} (left) and \fn{braph2} (right).
	}

%! FIG2 !%

The directory structure of \fn{braph2} and the relation with \fn{braph2genesis} is illustrated in \Figref{fig:genesis}.
All objects are derived from a base object called \code{Element} and written in a simplified pseudocode (files \fn{*.gen.m}) that is compiled into the actual elements (files \fn{*.m}) by the command \code{braph2genesis} (some examples of these elements are shown).
The compiled code can be launched by the command \code{braph2}.
The core of BRAPH~2 (gray shaded area) includes the compiler (\code{genesis}), the essential source code (\fn{src}), and the essential functionalities for the GUI (\fn{gui}, yellow-shaded area).
The users can easily add new brain surfaces (\fn{brainsurfs}), atlases (\fn{atlases}), example scripts and GUI pipelines (in the corresponding folder under \fn{pipelines}).
Furthermore, the users can add new elements such as new graphs (e.g., \code{GraphWU} in \fn{graphs}), measures (e.g., \code{Strength} in \fn{measures}), data types (e.g., \code{SubjectCON} in \fn{pipelines/connectivity}), data importers (e.g., \code{ImporterGroupSubjectCON\_XLS} in \fn{pipelines/connectivity}), data exporters (e.g., \code{ExporterGroupSubjectCON\_XLS} in \fn{pipelines/connectivity}), and analyses (e.g., \code{AnalyzeEnsemble\_CON\_WU} in \fn{pipelines/connectivity}) by writing new elements and recompiling the whole code: the new elements and their functionalities will be immediately available also in the GUI.
Finally, BRAPH~2 is provided with a set of unit tests (executable by the command \fn{test\_braph2}) that ensure the formal correctness of the code, including that of any newly added elements.

\section{Implementation of an Element}

We will now see how to implement a few concrete elements.

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{tcolorbox}[
	title=Light compilation of BRAPH~2
]
To speed up the compilation of BRAPH~2 when trying these examples, it is possible to perform a light version of the compilation using the script \code{braph2genesis\_with\_rollcall}, which permits one to exclude/include specific folders or elements, as shown in \Coderef{cd:rollcall}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	label=cd:rollcall,
	caption={
		{\bf BRAPH~2 genesis with rollcall.}
		Using \code{braph2genesis\_with\_rollcall} (which is found in the folder \fn{sandbox}), it is possible to exclude some folders and elements, which are defined in the variable \code{rollcall}.
		You can place your elements in the folder \fn{sandbox}.
	}
]
¤...¤
%% Add here all included and excluded folders and elements
% '-folder'                 the folder and its elements will be excluded
%
% '+folder'                 the folder is included, but not its elements
%   '+_ElementName.gen.m'   the element is included,
%                           if the folder is included
%
% '+folder*'                the folder and its elements are included
%   '-_ElementName.gen.m'   the element is excluded,
%                           if the folder and its elements are included
% (by default, the folders are included as '+folder*')
rollcall = { ...
    '+util*', '-_Exporter.gen.m', '+_Importer.gen.m', ...
    '+ds*', '-ds_examples', ...
    '-atlas', ...
    '-gt', ...
    '-cohort', ...
    '-analysis', ...
    '-nn', ...
    '-gui', '-gui_examples', ...
    '-brainsurfs', ...
    '-atlases', ...
    '-graphs', ...
    '-measures', ...
    '-neuralnetworks', ...
    '-pipelines', ...
    '+test*', ...
    '+sandbox*' ...
    };
¤...¤
\end{lstlisting}

This same approach (appropriately altering the included/excluded folders and elements) can also be used to reduce the compilation time when developing new functionalities.

Importantly, the directory \fn{braph2genesis} must be in the MatLab file path and the directory \fn{braph2} must not be in the MatLab file path.
The compiled BRAPH~2 is saved in \fn{brap2\_with\_rollcall}, which is ignored by GIT.
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{fullwidth}

\subsection{A Simple Calculator}

You will now create your first element (\Coderef{cd:ao}), a simple calculator that contains two numbers (which are data scalar props) and calculates their sum and difference (which are result scalar props).
