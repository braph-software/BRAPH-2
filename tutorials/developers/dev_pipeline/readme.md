# Adapt a Pipeline Script

[![Tutorial Adapt a Pipeline Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Download-red?style=flat-square&logo=adobe-acrobat-reader)](dev_pipeline.pdf)

This is the developer tutorial for adapting a pipeline script. 
In this tutorial, you will learn how to edit a "*.braph2" file to change the steps of a pipeline. Here, you will use as an example the pipeline `Pipeline Structural Multiplex Comparison BUD` in the file "pipeline_structural_multiplex_comparison_bud.braph2" (the pipeline for comparing two groups of subjects using structural multiplex data and binary undirected graphs at fixed densities) and adapt it in order to add a third group for structural multiplex.

You will adapt in `Pipeline Structural Multiplex Comparison BUD` in the file "pipeline_structural_multiplex_comparison_bud.braph2" as shown in Code 1. The changes are highlighted in the comments.

> % 2. It loads the data of two groups of subjects from two directories (e.g., ST_MP_group_1_XLS and ST_MP_group_2_XLS).
> % 3. It analyzes the first group using structural multiplex analyses (ST_MP) based on binary unidrected graphs at fixed densities (BUD).
> % 4. It analyzes the second group using the same parameters selected for the first group.
> % 5. It compares the results of the two analyses.
