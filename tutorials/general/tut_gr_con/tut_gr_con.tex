\title{Group of Subjects with Connectivity Data}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent
For \emph{connectivity data}, a connectivity matrix per subject is already available and can be directly imported into the relative analysis pipeline. For example, the connectivity matrix could correspond to white matter tracts obtained from dMRI or pre-calculated coactivations maps obtained from fMRI data.
This Tutorial explains how to prepare and work with this kind of data.

\section{Open the GUI}

In most analyses, the group GUI is the second step after you have selected a brain atlas. You can open it by typing \code{braph2} in the MatLab's terminal, which allows you to select a pipeline containing the steps required to perform your analysis and upload a brain atlas. After these steps have been completed you can upload your group's data, as shown in \Figref{fig:02}.

\fig{figure}
	{fig:02}
	{
	\includegraphics{fig02.png}
	}
	{Upload the data of a group of subjects}
	{
	Steps to upload a group of subjects with connectivity data using the GUI and an example dataset: 
	{\bf a} Open the group GUI.
	{\bf b} Import a folder containing the connectivity matrices in XLS or TXT format (see below for details on their format).
	To upload the test connectivity data:
	{\bf c}-{\bf f} navigate to the BRAPH~2.0 folder \fn{pipelines}, {\bf d} \fn{connectivity},  {\bf e}\fn{Example data CON XLS}, and {\bf f} select the folder containing the connectivity matrices of one group \fn{CON\_Group\_1\_XLS}.
	}

To open the GUI and upload the brain connectivity data, you can also do it from the command line (i.e., without opening an analysis pipeline) by typing the commands in \Coderef{cd:launch}.

\section{Visualize the Group Data}

After completing the steps described in \Figref{fig:02}, you can see the data (\Figref{fig:03}a), and change the Group ID, name, and notes (\Figref{fig:03}b).

	{Edit the group metadata}
	{
	Information that can be changed in the GUI: 
	{\bf a} The ID, name, and notes of each subject.
	{\bf b} The ID, name, and notes of the group.
	}

\section{Visualize Each Subject's Data}

Finally, you can open each subject's connectivity matrix by selecting the subject, right click, and select ``Open selection'' (\Figref{fig:04}a), which shows the matrix values (\Figref{fig:04}b). Here, you can also change the subject's metadata (ID, label, notes), its variables of interest, and the values of its connectivity matrix.

	{Edit the individual subject data.}
	{
	{\bf a}  Each subject's connectivity matrix can be opened by selecting the subject, right click, and select ``Open selection''
	{\bf b} In this subject GUI, it is possible to view and edit the metadata of the subject (ID, label, notes), its variables of interest (in this case, age and sex), and the values of the connectivity matrix.

\section{Preparation of the Data to be Imported}

To be able to import connectivity data into BRAPH~2.0, you need to include the connectivity matrices for each subject in excel or text format inside a folder with the name of the group. Below you can see how your group directory should look like as well as an example of a brain connectivity matrix.

\fig{figure*}
	{fig:05}
	{
	[h!]
	\includegraphics{fig05.png}
	}
	{Data preparation}
	{
	The data should be organised in the following format:
	{\bf a} The connectivity matrices from each subject should be included in one folder (for example, \fn{CON\_group\_1\_XLS}). 
	{\bf b} Each matrix should contain the connectivity values between each pair of brain regions denoted by the rows and columns. In example, the (simulated) values in the matrix correspond to the fractional anisotropy (white matter integrity) of anatomical connections derived from diffusion weighted imaging.
	} 

\section{Adding Covariates}

\fig{figure*}
	{fig:06}
	{
	[h!]
	\includegraphics{fig06.png}
	}
	{Edit the Covariates}
	{
	Information that can be changed in the Covariates file: 
	{\bf a} The names of the variables of interest (vois).
	{\bf b} In case the vois are categorical, you can state which categories they have.
	}
	
It is very common to have \emph{variables of interest} (i.e., \emph{covariates} and \emph{correlates}) in an analysis. In BRAPH~2.0, these variables of interest should be included in a separate excel file placed just outside the group's folder and with the same name as the folder followed by \fn{.vois} (\Figref{fig:06}a). This file should have a specific format (\Figref{fig:06}b):
\begin{itemize}

\item[Subject IDs (column A).]
Column A should contain the subject IDs starting from row 3.

\item[Variables of interest (column B and subsequent columns).]
Column B (and subsequent columns) should contain the variables of interest (one per column). 
In this example we have ``Age'' and ``Sex'', as in the example file, as well as the additional ``Education''.
In each column, row 1 should contain the name of the variable of interest, row 2 should contain the categories separated by a return (only for categorical variables of interest, like ``Sex'' and ``Education''), and the subsequent rows the values of the variable of interest for each subject.

\end{itemize}
