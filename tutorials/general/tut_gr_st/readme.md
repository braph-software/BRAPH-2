# Group of Subjects with Structural Data

[![Tutorial Group of Subjects with Structural Data](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Download-red?style=flat-square&logo=adobe-acrobat-reader)](tut_gr_st.pdf)

For *structural data*, we will upload a file containing the structural values for different brain areas across subjects that belong to the same group. For example, the structural values could correspond to cortical thickness or gray matter volumes obtained from T1-weighted MRI data. Then a connectivity matrix is computed using correlations in structural values between each pair of brain regions. This Tutorial explains how to prepare and work with this kind of data.

## Generation of Example Data

If you don't have the `Example data ST XLS` folder inside `structural`, then you can generate it by running the commands referenced below.

```matlab
create_data_ST_XLS()  % generates the example structural XLS data folder.
create_data_ST_TXT()  % generates the example structural TXT data folder.
```

## Open the GUI

In most analyses, the group GUI is the second step after you have selected a brain atlas. You can open it by typing `braph2` in MatLab's terminal, which allows you to select a pipeline containing the steps required to perform your analysis and upload a brain atlas. After these steps have been completed you can upload your group's data directly (Figure 2c-f) after clicking "Load Group".

> **Figure 2. Upload the data of a group of subjects.**
> Steps to upload a group of subjects with structural data using the GUI and an example dataset:
> **a** Open the group GUI.
> **b** Import the structural values in XLS or TXT format (see below for details on their format).
>	To upload the test structural data:
> **c-f** navigate to the BRAPH 2.0 folder `pipelines`, **d** `structural`, **e** `Example data ST XLS`, and **f** select the structural values of one group `ST_Group_1_XLS`.

> **GUI launch from command line**
>
> You can also open the GUI and upload the brain structural data using the command line (i.e., without opening an analysis pipeline) by typing the commands referenced below. In this case, you can upload the data as shown in Figure 2a-f.
> 
> Commands to open the GUI and upload the brain structural data:
> 
> ```matlab
> gr = Group('SUB_CLASS', 'SubjectST');  % creates a new object Group to use structural values for assessing connectivity i.e., SubjectST.
> 
> gui = GUIElement('PE', gr);  % creates a GUI to upload the group data.
> gui.get('DRAW');  % draws the GUI.
> gui.get('SHOW');  % shows the GUI.
> ```

## Visualize the Group Data

After completing the steps described in the Figure 2, you can see the data as shown in Figure 3a, and change the Group ID, name, and notes as in Figure 3b.

> ![Edit the group metadata](fig03.jpg)

> **Figure 3. Edit the group metadata.** 
> **a** The GUI of the group's structural data.
> **b** The information you see on this GUI that can be changed. In this example, we have edited the ID, name, and notes of the group but can also change the subject's specific information.

## Visualize Each Subject's Data

Finally, you can open each subject's structural values by selecting the subject, right-click, and select "Open selection" as shown in Figure 4a, which shows the structural values in Figure 4b. Here, you can also change the subject's metadata (ID, label, notes), its variables of interest, and the structural values.

> ![Edit the individual subject data](fig04.jpg)
> 
> **Figure 4. Edit the individual subject data.** 
> **a** Each subject's structural values can be opened by selecting the subject,  right-click, and select "Open selection".
> **b** In this subject GUI, it is possible to view and edit the metadata of the subject (ID, label, notes), its variables of interest (in this case, age and sex), and the structural values. 

## Preparation of the Data to be Imported

To be able to import structural data into BRAPH 2.0, you need to include the structural values for all subjects in a single file in excel or text format. Below you can see how this file should look like.

> ![Data preparation](fig05.jpg)
>
> **Figure 5. Data preparation.**
> The data organization should follow this format:
> **a** The structural values from each subject belonging to the same group should be included in a single file (for example, ST_Group_1_xlsx). 
> **b** This file should contain the subject's IDs, label and any relevant notes, followed by the structural values for each brain region belonging to a brain atlas. In this example, the (simulated) values correspond to the cortical thickness of 148 brain regions derived from T1-weighted MRI.
 
## Adding Covariates

When analyzing data, it's a common practice to incorporate *variables of interest*, which can be *covariates* or *correlates*. In BRAPH 2.0, these variables of interest must be stored in a separate excel file located just outside the group's folder. The file should share the group folder's name, but with a `.vois` extension, as shown in Figure 6a. The file must adhere to a specific format outlined in Figure 6b:

- **Subject IDs (column A).** Starting from row 3, column A should list the subject IDs.
  
- **Variables of interest (column B and subsequent columns).** Column B and the following columns should contain the variables of interest, one per column. Using this example, we see variables like "Age" and "Sex", along with an additional "Education" variable. For each column:
  - Row 1: The name of the variable of interest.
  - Row 2: Categories separated by a return (only for categorical variables of interest, like "Sex" and "Education").
  - Subsequent rows: The values of the variable of interest for each subject.

> The editable information in the Covariates file includes:
> **a** The names of the variables of interest (vois).
> **b** For categorical vois, you can specify the categories they belong to.
