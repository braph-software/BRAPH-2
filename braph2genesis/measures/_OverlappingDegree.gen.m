%% ¡header!
OverlappingDegree < Degree (m, overlapping degree) is the graph overlapping degree.

%%% ¡description!
The overlapping degree of a graph is the sum of the degrees of a node in 
all layers. 

%%% ¡shape!
shape = Measure.NODAL;

%%% ¡scope!
scope = Measure.SUPERGLOBAL;

%%% ¡parametricity!
parametricity = Measure.NONPARAMETRIC;
