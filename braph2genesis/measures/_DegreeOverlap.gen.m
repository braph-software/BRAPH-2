%% ¡header!
DegreeOverlap < EdgeOverlap (m, degree overlap) is the graph degree overlap.

%%% ¡description!
The degree overlap is the number of edges connected to a node in all layers. 
Connection weights are ignored in calculations.

%%% ¡shape!
shape = Measure.NODAL;

%%% ¡scope!
scope = Measure.SUPERGLOBAL;

%%% ¡parametricity!
parametricity = Measure.NONPARAMETRIC;

%%% ¡prop!
M (result, cell) is the degree overlap.
%%%% ¡calculate!
g = m.get('G'); % graph from measure class
[l, ls] = g.layernumber();

if l == 0
    value = {};
