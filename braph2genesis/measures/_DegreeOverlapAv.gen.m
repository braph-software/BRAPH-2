%% ¡header!
DegreeOverlapAv < DegreeOverlap (m, average degree overlap) is the graph average degree overlap.

%%% ¡description!
The average degree overlap is the average of the number of edges connected 
to a node in all layers. Connection weights are ignored in calculations.

%%% ¡shape!
shape = Measure.GLOBAL;

%%% ¡scope!
scope = Measure.SUPERGLOBAL;

%%% ¡parametricity!
parametricity = Measure.NONPARAMETRIC;

%%% ¡prop!
M (result, cell) is the average degree overlap.
%%%% ¡calculate!
