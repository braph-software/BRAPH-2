BetweennessCentrality < Measure (m, betweenness centrality) is the graph betweenness centrality.

%%% ¡description!
The betweenness centrality of a graph is the fraction of all shortest paths in the 
graph that pass through a given node. Nodes with high values of betweenness 
centrality participate in a large number of shortest paths.
