OverlappingStrength < Strength (m, overlapping strength) is the graph overlapping strength.

%%% ¡description!
The overlapping strength of a graph is the sum of the strengths of a node in 
all layers. 
  
%%% ¡shape!
shape = Measure.NODAL;

%%% ¡scope!
scope = Measure.SUPERGLOBAL;

%%% ¡parametricity!
parametricity = Measure.NONPARAMETRIC;
