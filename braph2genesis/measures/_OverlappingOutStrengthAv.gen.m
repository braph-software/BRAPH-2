OverlappingOutStrengthAv < OverlappingOutStrength (m, average overlapping out-strength) is the graph average overlapping out-strength.

%%% ¡description!
The average overlapping out-strength of a graph is the average of the sum of the 
out-strengths of a node in all layers. 

%%% ¡shape!
shape = Measure.GLOBAL;

%%% ¡scope!
scope = Measure.SUPERGLOBAL;

%%% ¡parametricity!
parametricity = Measure.NONPARAMETRIC;

%% ¡props_update!

%%% ¡prop!
M (result, cell) is the average overlapping out-strength.
%%%% ¡calculate!
g = m.get('G');  % graph from measure class
overlapping_out_strength = calculateValue@OverlappingOutStrength(m, prop);

value = {mean(cell2mat(overlapping_out_strength))};
