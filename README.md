An object-oriented software that provides pipelines for conventional brain connectivity analysis as well as more advanced methods, including multilayer networks and deep learning methods.

# Installation

BRAPH 2 requires at least **MATLAB R2021a**. BRAPH 2 requires both **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox** and **Parallel Computing Toolbox**. For deep learning analysis, **Deep Learning Toolbox** and **Deep Learning Toolbox Converter for ONNX Model Format** are also needed.

To install BRAPH 2, first clone this repository or download via zip. 
After launching MATLAB, change the current folder to **braph2genesis** and run *braph2genesis* (you may have to add it to the path). This installation takes around 5 minutes.
The installation will be only needed once, or every time you add a new functionality to BRAPH 2.
You can also check the <a href="http://braph.org/software/braph-2/ ">installation section</a> on our website.

# Using BRAPH 2

BRAPH 2 is a powerful tool that transforms scripts to pipelines.
Each provided pipeline comes with an example folder where you can run the example script to perform the analysis/comparison on the example data.
Please check the <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/">tutorial section</a> for the step-by-step instructions and more details on our website.
