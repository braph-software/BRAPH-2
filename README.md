An object-oriented software that provides pipelines for conventional brain connectivity analysis as well as more advanced methods, including multilayer networks and deep learning methods.

# Installation

BRAPH 2 requires at least **MATLAB R2021a**. BRAPH 2 requires both **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox** and **Parallel Computing Toolbox**. For deep learning analysis, **Deep Learning Toolbox** and **Deep Learning Toolbox Converter for ONNX Model Format** are also needed.

To install BRAPH 2, first download BRAPH 2.
From our GitHub repository, you can find the latest stable version in the branch <a href="https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab/tree/master">master</a> and the latest development version in the branch <a href="https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab/tree/develop">develop</a>.
You can also download BRAPH 2 from our <a href="http://braph.org/software/braph-2/">website</a>.

After unzipping the downloaded file into the desired directory and launching MATLAB, change the current folder to **braph2genesis** and run *braph2genesis* (you may have to add it to the path). This installation takes around 5 minutes.
The installation will be only needed once.
You can also follow the <a href="http://braph.org/software/braph-2/">Installation</a> section from our website.

# BRAPH 2 usage examples

BRAPH 2 is a powerful tool that transforms scripts to pipelines. We provide example data in order to test the different analyses and comparisons from the provided pipelines. Please check the <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/">Tutorials</a> section from our website for the step-by-step instructions and more details.
