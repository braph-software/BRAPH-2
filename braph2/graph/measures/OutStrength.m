    % OutStrength Out-strength measure
    % OutStrength provides the out-strength of a node for weighted 
    % directed (WD) graphs.
    %
    % It is calculated as the sum of all weights of the outward edges
    % connected to a node within a layer, i.e., it is the sum of the 
    % columns of the adjacency matrix.
