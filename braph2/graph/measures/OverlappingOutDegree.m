    % OverlappingOutDegree Overlapping out-degree measure
    % OverlappingOutDegree provides the overlapping out-degree of a node for  
    % binary directed (BD) and weighted directed (WD) multiplexes. 
    %
    % It is calculated as the sum of the number of outward edges connected to the
    % node in all layers, i.e., it is the sum of the out-degrees of a node in
    % all layers.
