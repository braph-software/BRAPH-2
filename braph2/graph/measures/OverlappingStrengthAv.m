classdef OverlappingStrengthAv < OverlappingStrength
    % OverlappingStrengthAv Average overlapping strength measure
    % OverlappingStrengthAv provides the average overlapping strength of a 
    % node for weighted undirected (WU) multiplexes. 
    %
    % It is calculated as the average of the sum of the strengths of a 
    % node in all layers, i.e., it is the mean of the overlapping strength 
    % within each layer.
