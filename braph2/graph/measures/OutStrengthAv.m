    % OutStrengthAv Average out-strength measure
    % OutStrengthAv provides the average out-strength of a node for weighted 
    % directed (WD) graphs.
    %
    % It is calculated as the average of the sum of all weights of the outward edges 
    % connected to a node within a layer, i.e., it is the mean of the out-strength 
    % within each layer.
