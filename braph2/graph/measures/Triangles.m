    % Triangles Triangles measure
    % Triangles provides the number of triangles of a node for binary
    % undirected (BU), binary directed (BD), weighted undirected (WU) and 
    % weighted directed (WD) graphs. 
    %
    % It is calculated as the number of a node's neighbor pairs that are   
    % connected to each other within a layer. In weighted graphs, the triangles are 
    % calculated as geometric mean of the weights of the edges forming
    % the triangle. For directed graphs the user can set the rule to
    % calculate the triangles (setting 'DirectedTrianglesRule').
