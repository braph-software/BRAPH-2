classdef BetweennessCentrality < Measure
    % BetweennessCentrality Betweenness centrality measure
    % BetweennessCentrality provides the betweenness centrality of a node for 
    % binary undirected (BU), binary directed (BD), weighted undirected (WU) 
    % and weighted directed (WD) graphs. 
    %
    % It is calculated as the fraction of all shortest paths in the graph
    % that pass through a node. Nodes with high values of betweenness 
    % centrality participate in a large number of shortest paths.
