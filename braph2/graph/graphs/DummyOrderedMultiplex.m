    % DummyOrderedMultiplex An Ordered Multiplex graph
    % DummyOrderedMultiplex represents an ordered multiplex graph.
    %
    % DummyOrderedMultiplex is constituted by two binary directed graphs and
    % one weighted directed graph. Thus, it only accepts a number of layers
    % equal to three. It is a sequence of layers with ordinal connections.
