function P2 = pvalue2(observed_difference, random_differences)
% PVALUE2 Calculates the two-tailed p-value
%
% P2 = PVALUE2(OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE, RANDOM_DIFFERENCES) calculates the
% two-tailed P-value of OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE with respect to the
% distribution given by RANDOM_DIFFERENCES.
%
% This function admits various kinds of inputs:
%
% 1) OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE is a scalar, a vector or a matrix with the difference.
% RANDOM_DIFFERENCES must be a cell array of samples, where each cell contains a
% scalar, a vector or a matrix with random variables.
% P1 is a scalar, a vector or a matrix with the two-sided p-values.
%
% 2) OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE is a cell containing a scalar, a vector or a
% matrix with the difference.
% RANDOM_DIFFERENCES must be a cell array of samples, where each cell contains a
% scalar, a vector or a matrix with random variables.
% P1 is a cell containing a scalar, a vector or a matrix with the two-sided
% p-values.
%
% 3) OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE is a cell containing multiple scalar, vectors or
% matrices with the difference.
% RANDOM_DIFFERENCES must be a cell array of with the same format as
% OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE.
% P1 is a cell array of with the same format as OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE with
% the two-sided p-values.
